NAME
    Ham::Scrape - Perl extension for scraping Amateur Radio callsign info
    and real-time positional information from the Internet. This module
    scrapes the information from three web sites (QRZ, FindU and APRSWorld),
    and supports printing of the key fields to console to file as raw ASCII
    or formatted in an XML document structure.

SYNOPSIS
      use Ham::Scraper;
  
      # Retreive QRZ information for callsign
      my %qrz = Ham::Scraper::QRZ($callsign);
      my $name = $qrz{Name};
      my $location = $qrz{CityStateZip};
      my $timeZone = $qrz{TimeZone};
      my $gmtOffset = $qrz{GMTOffset};
      my $grid = $qrz{Grid};
      # Use name, location, grid, etc. in program.

      # Scrape real-time position report information (as XML) from FindU
      my $aprsXml = Ham::Scraper::FindUXml($callsign);

    Whether you are looking to scrape QRZ, Findu or APRSWorld information,
    you can have the results return in a hash or as simple XML document. A
    subroutine returning XML is suffixed with Xml.
